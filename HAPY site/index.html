# 2010-10-2? beta.1 create automation for At-A-Glance calendar with query string activation
# 2010-11-02 beta.2 remove query string activation, rename query string (caltest > date)
# beta.3 2012-02-10 original data removed; testing external file call (that didn't work -- let's try setting up the test file with all the data ready for the UI)
# beta.3a 2012-02-10 let's try file_get_contents instead (nope, still didn't work. :( )
# beta.3b 2012-02-11 back up a step, let's put part of the contents of the file into a variable, see if that works
# beta.3c 2012-02-11 try file_get_contents again, with a simplified data file
# beta.3d 2012-02-11 going back to the variable, gotta figure out what's not working with the file call
# beta.3e 2012-02-11 Try this a different way, explode out \r\n, \r, and \n, and implode in a return character
# beta.3f 2012-02-11 array_unshift the cal_data, I think that's throwing things off.  (I wonder if it was all along???  Hmmm...)
# beta.3g 2012-02-11 Let's try it without removing carriage returns.  (But that *was* good practice...)
