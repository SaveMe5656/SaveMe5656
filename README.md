hello; I exist **:p**

I'm CommandCreep, or just "Creep" for short. I'm 17, a self-deprecative idiot, and have a pretty warped sense of humor. I also tend to worry about things too much. **:D**<br>
My programming knowledge is somewhat limited, but metaphorically I like throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks. I tend to see what I can get out of just screwing around with code.<br>
Most of my junk here is just that. I'm always open to any constructive criticism on it, so feel free to pull an issue on anything you think could use some tweaking.
